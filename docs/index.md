# Optimization Engineer

Howard specializes in the creation and application of optimization algorithms to big data problems, particularly the creation, training, and evaluation of models that are data-driven (i.e. deep learning applications) and require hard constraints be satisfied (e.g. large linear systems of equations for physical systems). Below is an example of recent work published in Nature's Scientific Reports.
